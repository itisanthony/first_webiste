# first_webiste
In my first HTML project this time, I created a webiste about biodata and my experience on this webiste.
This website itself consists of HTML files and image files as well as style.css files


For setting this website , you must have https://www.w3schools.com account as host of this server, we just design our website with HTML File;
after you logn in at w3school website -> clik space -> make a new template -> write html file

i give you html file in this respitory, you can chek it and design it . Thank you.
